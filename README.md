# Papers
During my long life for study and research, there must be many papers I need to read. And the work in the paper is sometimes needed to be reproduced for scientific research aim. Therefore, I create this repository to store all my reproduction.
- Image Hashing
I re-do the [work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9107479) in the image hashing area. The result is not so good, but the image datasets here are really precious.
